=============

Android mobile application using the Google Maps API, Picasso, and ActionBarSherlock. We are in the process of phasing out the SQL lite backend for testing for a real, working backend with a python API. Stay Tuned!

// TODO
- Add menu button to the right of the tabs for the actionbar
- USE http://square.github.io/okhttp/ for getting images
- Reload spot from map to get rating values when altered (may have to be on the backend)
- Disable locate on map button if you came from the map
	- OR (or possibly and) - put something after address to say "or locate on map"
- Make sure all old code is taken out
- Diff markers for adding a spot
- TOGGLE FOR MAP/SATELITE VIEW (find a button for this)
- Quit activity when returning from mail

// WishList
- Start using 9patch images (from android or fb and color them in photoshop) for things!
- sliders for numbers on ratings for spots


// TODO: FOR BACKEND
- Make sure users can only rate photos/spots once
- rider field (user or string)
- add up and down ratings for spots
- videos along with photos?
- Delete endpoints
